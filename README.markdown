# Feedly Counter

Feedly Counter is a Chrome extension for [Feedly](http://feedly.com),
which allows you to see at a glance when you've got
unread articles, and gives you easy one-click-access
to your feeds.

I made this as an alternative to the original
[extension](http://bit.ly/feedlydl) when it magically lost this option.

## Install

You can install this extension directly from the
Google Chrome webstore by clicking this banner:
